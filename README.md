### Firebase Chess

Sample demo app to learn about Firebase, and in particular using a real-time database for interactive streams.
The web app allows you to create chess games which are uniquely addressed, and play with a friend in real time.

There is no security nor authentication, all games are public and can be randomly deleted. There is also no
enforcement of rules, players are free to place their pieces wherever they want, even if it violates the rules
of chess.

### Local Dev

```
npm install
node app.js
```
